summary: This article will cover everything I've learnt about RUST programming language

Rust is a compiled language which means the human readable source code
is being converted into the type of executable file that can then be ran
by any appropriate machine, unlike interpreted languages like python
where you always need interpreter of that certain language to run
the code straight from the source code. 
    The compiler for rust is rustc, but it is more convenient to work
with the projects using cargo package manager. Follow instructions
in [this](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) webpage to install
them both. 

```bash
bash-3.2$ zsh
➜  first-cookings cargo new rust-project
     Created binary (application) `rust-project` package

➜  first-cookings cd rust-project 
➜  rust-project git:(master) ✗ tree -L 2
.
├── Cargo.toml
└── src
    └── main.rs

```

It is statically and strongly typed programming language with no
need to set the types explicitly. Instead creating the variable that
has no value at all will result in a compiletime error.

```rust
fn main() {
    let var;
}

//This will result in the error below
//error[E0282]: type annotations needed
```
