summary: Whatever technology I use eventually I meet the JS code, I am tired of not understanding some blocks there so here I'll write down some important JS/TS paradigms I've learnt

# Parallel Programming
Speaking of asynchronous processes in programing at all. Normally
codes are read line by line synchronously, but it occures that there
can be functions or processes or whatever there are, that create 
alternative codeline and perfrom instructions independently in a parellel
from the original sacred codeline. I watched Loki recently :)))
    So we just need some mechanisms to perform actions that are supposed to
happen in this alternative codeline after that asynchronous event ended. 
Those depend on this event and already belong to this codeline, if we perform
them in original codeline without waiting for the asynchronous function to end
then we won't still have the neccessary result from that alternative codeline.
    In TS/JS it is functions that can be asynchronous 
and there are three known mechanisms to handle them two of which are already
depracated.
    - Callbacks - A way to organize a chian of functions
    - Promises - The same functionality, but more readible code
    - Async/Await -  syntax sugar for promises
