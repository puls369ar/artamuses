# Notes
- Features of money are Medium of Exchange, Store of Value, Unit of Account, Salability, Hardness, Fungibility, Liquidity, Sovereignity
- Hardness is defined in stock-to-flow ratio. `Stock` is current supply of the good and the `Flow` is amount of goods produced per specified period of time. Good with high stock-to-flow value is *Hard Money* and is a good store, in contrary low stock-to-value good is an easy money and will lack the hardness because of the ease of it's production.
- There are three aspects across which a good should be salable. Salability across space, scales and time. The good that can be easily divided into smaller units and grouped into larger groups is considered scale salable, this let's it's holder to sell the money in which quantity it is neccessary to do so. Salability across space simply means that the money can be easily transported. And the final most important salability is time. It is good's ability to hold it's value after any amount of time passes. It is the second function of a money to be good for the Store of Value. For this the good shouldn't be prone to corrosion or any other type of decaying. But physical loose of value across time isn't the only conditional for good's unit to not loose it's value. This can also happen because of it's supply increment due to it's primitiveness
- With all of this let's say technical characteristics of money it is important for it to be out of control of any central authority like governments. Modern day fiat USD can be printed as much as America's government would like it for it's national/political interests. No fiat money can be considered *Sound Money*. Real sound money should be in full control of it legitimate owner and be accessable for trading in free market.


Quotes
- Modern day *Keynesian money model* just pretends to prevent inflation by manually meddling supplies
- Economist Julian Simon challenging Paul Ehrlich to bet about particular resource supplies and their prices
- Michael Kremer argues that human progress lies in solving probems through technolgical solutions rather then in raw materials amount
- By Malthusian model, as progress is depended on human innovation, the more is population the more will be there be the critical group of people creating more ingenious ideas that will generate more economical value and human goods

Bitcoin
- Bitcoin itself is slow, expensive and thus inconvenient for single transaction performance for simplest market actions. For busineeses to use Bitcoin as an everyday tool for registering each action they should implement L2 solutions or become an intermediary. Both solutions are usually not decentralised and contradict Bitcoin's philosophy and values
- One of the main problems of Bitocin is Scalability today well known as one of the *Blockchain Trilemma* problems. Maximum TX capacity of Bitcoin block is smaller then VISA data center can handle, blocksize is 1MB and the waitime for new block to be validated and merged is 10 minutes. there were several attemts of changing some of bitcoin technical features by modifying the protocol and aplying hard fork for it. But not a one of it succeded in assembling critical amount of supporters that would  agree on new rules and become a node of newly forked Bitcoin protocol. There many project now in 2024 though that are technically advanced and offer better DeFi functionality, some of them surpassed VISA capacity a long time ago.
- First time we have a currency candidate for global universal currency. The currency that serves for no interests of particular country or group or individual person. 
- Unlike natural assets bitcoin is a good one for value storage, because besides being limited and non-inflatory it is also not possible to produce amounts of bitcoin units larger in future then it can be produced in present. This prevents bitcoin's value decline after purchasing it for long-term storage. In terms of the book this feature is called *Time Scalability* of the money
- No other coin will have Bitcoin's sovereignity as Bitocin's itself created it's brand organically and it never needed dedicated team specializing in "selling" it and elaborating the value laying behind Bitcoin as a currency. There were members of Bitcoin contributors that Satoshi Nakamoto trusted himself very much, and even after therse member's attemts of radically changing Bitcoin's core economical and technical features resulted in failure caused not by particular group or individual, but bitcoin's independent, self-mainaining conservative design.
- Truly First implementation of Blockchain Technolgy is Bitcoin and they are synonyms in a way. But I won't agree with author that no other application can be used for blockchain, although I agree that that presence of currency and financial incentives drive blockchain demandable for users. Much more can be done with this technology besides DeFi that has potential. My favorites are DAO, Digital Communications and Digital Non-Fungability.
