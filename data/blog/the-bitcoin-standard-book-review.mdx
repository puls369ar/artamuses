# Notes
### Chapter 4: 
- Modern day *Keynesian money model* just pretends to prevent inflation by manually meddling supplies

### Chapter 9: What Is Bitcoin Good For
* Store of Value
* Individual Sovereignity

Store of Value
- Economist Julian Simon challenging Paul Ehrlich to bet about particular resource supplies and their prices
- Michael Kremer argues that human progress lies in solving probems through technolgical solutions rather then in raw materials amount
- By Malthusian model, as progress is depended on human innovation, the more is population the more will be there be the critical group of people creating more ingenious ideas that will generate more economical value and human goods

### Common
- Unlike natural assets bitcoin is a good one for value storage, because besides being limited and non-inflatory it is also not possible to produce amounts of bitcoin units larger in future then it can be produced in present. This prevents bitcoin's value decline after purchasing it for long-term storage. In terms of the book this feature is called *Time Scalability* of the money
