# Notes
It turns out there are standards defining and evaluating money's quality and usability. There are several features of money. Perfect money should be Medium of Exchange, Store of Value, Unit of Account, Salable, Hard, Fungible, Liquid, and Sovereign. The first three are simple; let's see what the rest mean.

Hardness is defined in the stock-to-flow ratio. `Stock` is the current supply of the good, and the `Flow` is the amount of goods produced per specified period of time. The good which has a high stock-to-flow value is *Hard Money*, meaning it will keep its value across time and is good for storing assets long term. In contrast, low stock-to-flow money is a primitive type of money and will lack hardness because of the ease of its production.

Hard Money means it is salable across time, which is one of three dimensions of a good's salability. The remaining two are scale and space salability. A good that can be easily divided into smaller units and grouped into larger groups is considered scale salable. This lets its holder sell the money in the necessary quantity. Salability across space simply means that the money can be easily transported. Money hardness grants it time salability, but it should also not be prone to corrosion or any other type of decay; otherwise, its value will be lost, not because of the good's primitiveness but because of its physical features.

With all of this, let's observe the technical characteristics of money. It is important for money to be out of the control of any central authority like governments. Modern-day fiat USD can be printed as much as America's government would like for its national/political interests. No fiat money can be considered *Sound Money*. Real sound money should be in full control of its legitimate owner and be accessible for trading in a free market. Keynesian economics is a type of mechanism supporting government financial intervention in times of economic crises.

There are two controversial types of economies. One is Keynesian, and the other is Austrian. The author of the book is very against the philosophy of Keynes, which implies that the government should always intervene in the economy whenever it is in crisis. Be it in creating new jobs or programs, to achieve it, printing new fiat money is necessary, which contrasts with the whole idea of a hard, sovereign, sound money system and a healthy economy. In contrast to this implication, Austrian economy supporters argue that if the government provides stimulus checks, subsidized loans, or unemployment benefits, individuals and businesses may not adjust to economic realities, delaying necessary corrections.

# Bitcoin
Bitcoin itself is slow, expensive, and thus inconvenient for single transaction performance in the simplest market actions. For businesses to use Bitcoin as an everyday tool for registering each action, they should implement L2 solutions or become an intermediary. Both solutions are usually not decentralized and contradict Bitcoin's philosophy and values.

One of the main problems of Bitcoin is scalability, today well known as one of the *Blockchain Trilemma* problems. The maximum TX capacity of a Bitcoin block is smaller than what VISA's data center can handle. The block size is 1MB, and the wait time for a new block to be validated and merged is 10 minutes. There were several attempts at changing some of Bitcoin's technical features by modifying the protocol and applying a hard fork to it. But none of them succeeded in assembling a critical amount of supporters who would agree on new rules and become a node of the newly forked Bitcoin protocol. There are many projects now in 2024, though, that are technically advanced and offer better DeFi functionality. Some of them surpassed VISA capacity a long time ago.
For the first time, we have a currency candidate for a global universal currency. A currency that serves no interests of a particular country, group, or individual person.

Unlike natural assets, Bitcoin is a good one for value storage because, besides being limited and non-inflationary, it is also not possible to produce amounts of Bitcoin units larger in the future than can be produced in the present. This prevents Bitcoin's value from declining after purchasing it for long-term storage.

There is a story of Economist Julian Simon challenging Paul Ehrlich to bet on particular resource supplies and their prices. The story is told to illustrate that concerns about scarcity are often misplaced and that market forces and human ingenuity tend to overcome these concerns. This sets the stage for arguing that Bitcoin's properties, such as its fixed supply, make it a useful tool as a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account, and that these properties are a product of the technology itself and not a result of a central authority's design. This is relevant to the discussion of Bitcoin because one of the key features of Bitcoin is its fixed supply. The latter can't be the cause of having a full, sophisticated economy.

The same is also thought by Michael Kremer, implying that human progress lies in solving problems through technological solutions rather than in raw material amounts, and by Malthusians, too, believing that overpopulation isn't the problem, but quite the opposite. More human beings existing means that the critical percentage of humanity able to innovate and create products that make our lives better will be higher.

No other coin will have Bitcoin's sovereignty, as Bitcoin itself created its brand organically and never needed a dedicated team specializing in "selling" it and elaborating on the value behind Bitcoin as a currency. There were members of Bitcoin contributors that Satoshi Nakamoto trusted very much, and even after these members' attempts at radically changing Bitcoin's core economic and technical features, they resulted in failure. This was caused not by a particular group or individual, but by Bitcoin's independent, self-maintaining conservative design.

The first true implementation of Blockchain Technology is Bitcoin, and they are synonyms in a way. But I won't agree with the author that no other application can be used for blockchain, although I agree that the presence of currency and financial incentives drives blockchain demand among users. Much more can be done with this technology besides DeFi, which has potential. My favorites are DAO, Digital Communications, and Digital Non-Fungibility.

# Summary
Great material not only for those in the field of Web3 and the developer side of the business trying to understand the economy and the role Bitcoin plays in it. I, myself, as a developer, can confirm that you could build dApps without knowing anything about Bitcoin's philosophy, but we should always remember that Web3 developers are not just developers â€” they are evangelists of a newly forming technological sphere as well. It is also great for people who are trying to enter the world of crypto.
