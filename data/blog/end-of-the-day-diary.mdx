Can we count it as a #EndOfTheDayDiary?
It was a long, almost empty, intentionally borrified day. 
Although I managed to meet and help the friend, do the smartphone 
recovery and learn some little Solana theory, but I don't feel it is enough. 
Not going to the bar or to rave was a good decision, long run is 
waiting tomorrow morning.

It was the last working day before going to the long vacation in
the place I work as a barback. I understand this will be hard period of
time for barmans as there are no other barbacks working so much for this amount 
of salary.
