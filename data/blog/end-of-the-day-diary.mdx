Can we count it as a #EndOfTheDayDiary?
It was a long, almost empty, intentionally borrified day. 
Although I managed to meet and help the friend, do the smartphone 
recovery and learn some little Solana theory, but I don't feel it is enough. 
Not going to the bar or to rave was a good decision, long run is 
waiting tomorrow morning.

It was the last working day before going to the long vacation in
the place I work as a barback. I understand this will be hard period of
time for barmans as there are no other barbacks working so much for this amount 
of salary.

I did a lot of things today. Learnt new concepts from Solana, almost 
finished my book and entered the world of Akira Kurosawa. His 
"Seven Samurai" movie is old, black-white movie as usually his all 
movies are. At the end of the day I visited Varpet and didn't even order
anything. Rain started just as I arrived and I felt very happy sitting
under the cover in a beautiful atmospheric place, chill and cool
watching rain coming.

Today I started to feel that my procrastination may show itself again altough
it didn't start yet. Currently I have some free time for my IT activities and
running such diaries, but it won't last long. I have to clearly set the milestone
and continue working on learning Solana as a developer and for this I need to
have a robust clear answer to the question why do I need it. Need to figure it out.
The rest is good and I feel mentally and physically stable....YET.

It was another pause heh, Sorry. I am a sensitive personality. It causes sufferings, but it makes me alive at the end of the day
I am fine, I will be fine.

And here I m in love again, but this time it seems that she has many things
that I am looking for in partner and in healthy relationships. She is beautiful, smart, mature and free.
She has a taste and we have many common interests. I met her once and we had a good, promosing conversation
altough I offered not the best behaviour I could have, but it also may be my paranoia.
Second time I offered her to go to the music event with me on which she refused me telling she is bussy. I
saw after, really she was bussy at the day of the event. And the third time when I met her at the place that is
one of the favorites of both of us. I was just freezed and didn't even say hello, altough she might saw me there.
The accident was very stressfull. Why didn't I talk to her when I was waiting just for any little chance to talk to her.
It is not that she was bussy or with the people I don't know. I couldn't simply move and say hello.
This can mean either I am still not emotionally mature or subconciously I realize that I have my own shit
to handle in order to be enough confident to create a relationship with such a girl. By the way the girl I am talking to
is a good specialist in her discipline, as I said she is smart she is not a child, unlike other girls I had a crush on. 
In short she may be a high value woman I think I am not worth for. That's why I made a decision to hold for some time and 
perform some changes in my life. I want to use this possibility to grow and stimulate the motivation from this emotion of love
and desire. Time to master emotional stableness and use this opportunity to learn to mobilize the power of manifestation for the sake
of my own good. Short plan for tomorrow is
    -   Do the long run with the club
    -   Close the bar shift
    -   Get the papers from the bank for the VISA
