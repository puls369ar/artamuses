Can we count it as a #EndOfTheDayDiary?
It was a long, almost empty, intentionally borrified day. 
Although I managed to meet and help the friend, do the smartphone 
recovery and learn some little Solana theory, but I don't feel it is enough. 
Not going to the bar or to rave was a good decision, long run is 
waiting tomorrow morning.

It was the last working day before going to the long vacation in
the place I work as a barback. I understand this will be hard period of
time for barmans as there are no other barbacks working so much for this amount 
of salary.

I did a lot of things today. Learnt new concepts from Solana, almost 
finished my book and entered the world of Akira Kurosawa. His 
"Seven Samurai" movie is old, black-white movie as usually his all 
movies are. At the end of the day I visited Varpet and didn't even order
anything. Rain started just as I arrived and I felt very happy sitting
under the cover in a beautiful atmospheric place, chill and cool
watching rain coming.

Today I started to feel that my procrastination may show itself again altough
it didn't start yet. Currently I have some free time for my IT activities and
running such diaries, but it won't last long. I have to clearly set the milestone
and continue working on learning Solana as a developer and for this I need to
have a robust clear answer to the question why do I need it. Need to figure it out.
The rest is good and I feel mentally and physically stable....YET.
