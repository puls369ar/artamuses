# Introduction

I consider this book as my first one about marketing. Although in some books I read like Tim Ferris's *The 4-Hour Workweek* there are discussions about the marketing side of the matter, but the topics described in Ferris's book are not fully dedicated to marketing. I guess the Pareto Principle is pretty common to use in marketing literature, as I faced it in both books, I may face those in other books too. In this book, the author explains techniques in three time stages of the marketing process: Before The Sale, During The Sale, and After The Sale.

## Before The Sale

Be specific when describing your product or your services. For example, common:

> I am a highly responsible professional able to deliver high quality product for your business

can be replaced with:

> I can create a finalized `<PRODUCT_TYPE>` in a period not exceeding `<DEVELOPMENT_DURATION>` depending on complexity, so that it will `<ESTIMATED_RESULT_METRIC>` for your business.

Represent your product not only on behalf of the company, but also on behalf of the person, of the face. On platforms or pages where you sell the product, attach a video describing your product on the very headline. People will rather trust personalities than faceless abstract entities.

Choose the right target audience. You collect a group of prospects which you will offer your product later.

## During The Sale

Be the one who is a knowledgeable one in the sphere in which your product is related to. Be the one who constantly teaches that field and spreads the knowledge of it. That way, you cover two points discussed previously. First, you are a trusted face of the entity selling the product of the sphere in which you have an authority. Second, now you have a lot of value to offer for collecting leads.

Don't propose the product right from the beginning. As long as you have your prospects collected, give them something for free at the beginning related to the sphere your product is involved in. This can be anything material, book anything.

Keep an eye on stats and propose the product at the right time. Design a smooth sales process to convert your leads into customers.

Make your lead's first purchase an unforgettable experience. Maybe providing a little present together with it or pack it in an initial specific design.

## After The Sale

Use cross-selling and upselling techniques, meaning offering products related to the one that was purchased by the lead.

Constantly update your customers about new released products through mailing or other channels. If the product sold was an expensive one and brought a huge revenue, don't hesitate to send gifts together with product update newsletters.

You are not your product. It is important to create the system that will sustain your product without you, especially if it is the one that you are going to sell to someone or make it work by itself one day.

## Summary

Not technical, but practical and accessible manual. Yes, manual, because if not applied in practice, it won't be as beneficial as it is meant to be. Allan Dib wrote it to be applicable and even provided appropriate blanks to create architectures described in the book. What is left for us is to use it.

> You have only twenty-four hours a day, so the only way you can get more achieved in a day is by using other peopleâ€™s time
